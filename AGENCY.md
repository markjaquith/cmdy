## TASK.md

The `TASK.md` file describes the task being performed and should be kept updated as work progresses. This file serves as a living record of:

- What is being built or fixed
- Current progress and status
- Remaining work items
- Any important context or decisions

All work on this repository should begin by reading and understanding `TASK.md`. Whenever any significant progress is made, `TASK.md` should be updated to reflect the current state of work.

See `TASK.md` for the current task description and progress.
