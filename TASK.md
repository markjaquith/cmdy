I want to add an option (default false) to the main cmdy config called something like `overwriteShellCommand` that if true, when cmdy is run and a command is selected to be run, cmdy overwrites the last entry in the shell's history. Supporting bash and zsh. That way, after the command ends, you can press up-arrow and that command will be present, instead of the cmdy command.
